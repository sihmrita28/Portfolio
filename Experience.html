                <p><strong>15 July 2025 - 14 Aug 2025</strong></p>
                <p> At MDQuality Apps, I worked on-site with the front-end development team to build and maintain
                    responsive websites. I created a personal portfolio website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript. This role involved collaborating closely with UI/UX designers to align layouts and
                    animations with modern web standards. I also enhanced the functionality and user experience of web
                    forms, sliders, and section-based navigation. This internship sharpened my frontend development
                    skills and gave me insight into production-level code organization, browser compatibility, and live
                    deployment practices.

                <h1>2. Edunet Foundation - Power BI Intern </h1>
                <p><strong>20 Jan 2025 - 20 Feb 2025</strong></p>
                <p>I worked remotely as a data visualization intern, where I developed end-to-end Power BI dashboards
                    using real-world datasets. My responsibilities included cleaning and transforming raw data, using
                    DAX for calculated fields, and creating interactive visuals using filters, slicers, and KPIs. The
                    internship taught me how to convey complex data-driven stories through intuitive dashboards. I also
                    learned how to interpret business data for actionable insights, which enhanced my understanding of
                    data interpretation and real-time decision-making in a professional context.

                <h1>3. Reliance Industries Limited - Project Intern (On-Site)</h1>
                <p><strong>12 Aug 2024 - 11 Sep 2024</strong></p>
                <p>During this on-site internship at Reliance Limited, I worked on the SOAP (Smart Operations Automation
                    Platform) project, where I gained hands-on experience with industrial automation tools and
                    operational workflows. I assisted the team in identifying key areas for process automation and
                    contributed to optimizing existing systems. Through this internship, I became familiar with how
                    large-scale enterprises implement digital transformation strategies to improve efficiency, reduce
                    manual effort, and enhance scalability. It provided me with a strong foundation in industrial
                    applications of technology and project-based collaboration.

                <h1>4. Prodigy InfoTech - Cybersecurity Intern </h1>
                <p><strong>1 June 2024 - 30 June 2024</strong></p>
                <p>As a self-paced cybersecurity intern, I completed several core projects focused on encryption and
                    digital security. These included implementing Caesar Cipher for text encryption, building a
                    keylogger for logging keyboard inputs ethically, encrypting images using pixel manipulation, and
                    developing a basic packet sniffer using Python. This internship deepened my understanding of
                    cybersecurity principles, ethical hacking, and digital privacy concerns. It provided a solid
                    introduction to both defensive and offensive security strategies and emphasized the importance of
                    secure coding practices.

                <p><strong>1 March 2024 - 31 April 2024</strong></p>
                <p>As an online intern at UPR Tech India, I was introduced to the fundamentals of website design using
                    WordPress. I worked with drag-and-drop builders like Elementor and WPBakery to create clean,
                    responsive layouts without writing extensive code. I explored themes, widgets, and plugins to
                    enhance functionality and aesthetics. This internship helped me understand the role of
                    no-code/low-code tools in modern web development, and how to balance design creativity with
                    usability. It also familiarized me with CMS environments and content structuring best practices.
